# Bookmark Up
A simple, privacy-first tool to semantically organize your Brave Browser bookmarks, crafted by The Taxidermist at AD:HOC Codeworks.

## What It Does
- Reads your Brave `Bookmarks` file (locally, no funny business).
- Groups bookmarks by keywords (e.g., "Python Tutorial" → "Up Python").
- Updates your bookmark list with a new, taxidermied hierarchy.
- No network calls, no personal data access—just pure bookmark stuffing!

## Setup
1. Install Python 3.x.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run: `python bookmark_up.py`.

## Requirements
- Brave Browser (Mac path pre-set; tweak for Windows/Linux).
- `nltk` library for lightweight semantic magic.
